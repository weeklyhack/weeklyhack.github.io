For my second project, I wanted to get closer to my original goal - to learn a
new language every week. Therefore, this week, I took a look at a language I've
heard a lot of good and bad about: Go.

Go at first looked like javascript and python had a baby with C. The fact that Go
is a compiled language--a rarity these days--intrigued me. I had never really
used one extensively before for a project and this felt like the perfect excuse
to try.

After a week, I can say that Go has its quirks. [In fact, I wrote a whole blog
post about them.]()

### So, what did I write?

Every day, I push code with git at least 50 times. Usually, I run something
like `git push origin master`, a full 22 characters. There had to be a more
efficient way to push code. Am I lazy? Maybe. But, efficiency matters.
I tried some fancy shell aliases, and while they
were ok they never really worked quite right for my needs. I figured this
would be a perfect opportunity to write a solution.

Enter PH.

PH is an app that makes git push easier. Remember `git push origin master`?
Instead, do `ph om`. A full 18 characters shorter. Need to do something a little
more complex, like `git pull origin branch -v`? Simple, just do `ph
lobv`. Enough with my convoluted examples, here's it in action:

<div style="overflow: hidden; width: 100%;">
  <img alt="PH in action" src="/assets/images/posts/ph.gif" style="min-width: 500px;" />
</div>

<!--
### Still unconvinced?

PH can also analyze the git pushes that you make to tell you how to make them
better. Just run `ph inject`. PH will add a shell snippet to your shell's
profile to analyze your git pushes and pulls. Then, after a while, run `ph
report`. PH will tell you how you could have optimized all of your shell
commands to minimize typing. -->

## How can you use it?
[Installation instructions are in the README.](https://github.com/weekyhack/1-ph/blob/master/README.md)

### How did I do?
I was able to gain nearly 80% test coverage, but the only thing keeping me from
100% was that I couldn't find a mocking library for Go that worked for me and
was intuitive. 

Go gets a lot of things right. Pointers are done sensibly. Types are easy to understand when reading the code and have helped reduce errors as I work. Therefore, will I be using Go everyday from now on? Yes and no. Once Go has an official package manager and has matured as a platform, then I can see myself really getting into it.
